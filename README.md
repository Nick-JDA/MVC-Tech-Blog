Once the user has navigated to the sign-up/login page they can enter a name and password in the input boxes to create/login to an account. When user has signed in they can porceed to a post and leave a comment. Logged in users can also visit their dashboard by using the navigation bar which will present them with a form to create their post and display any posts they have already created. When on a users dashboard page a form will be present which can be filled out with a title of post and content of said post. Once a user has filled out the form fields and clicks the create button their post will display in their dashboard along with a delete and update button. Users can also view their posts on the homepage by using the home button in the navigation bar or clicking the title of the web page.
